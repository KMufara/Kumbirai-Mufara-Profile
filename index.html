		<h3> INTRODUCTION: </h3>
		<p> My name is Kumbirai Mufara, and my passion is technology.</p>
		
		<p> 
		I first discovered my love for programming and technology in 2013 when I was doing my first year of I.T in grade 10. The language I was introduced to at the time was Delphi, and I found it so amazing that I could put what was in my head out into the world. 
		</p>
		
		<p> 
		It was not going to be an easy journey though, as I was still in denial about what I was meant to concetrate on. After finishing my matric, I went to the University of Cape Town to study for a BBusSci Finance with Accounting (CA Stream). I remember taking a first year course from the Computer Science that was done in python. That ended up being my favourite course for the entire year. 2 years into my 4 year programme, I had to face the reality that I had no passion/ love for what I was doing, so I decided to walk away. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		After leaving accounting I knew that I wanted to go and study what I really liked, Computer Sciences (Programming). Unfortunately, The words of the wise held truth ("haste makes waste"). In a rush to cover for the "wasted time" used to study another program, I completely neglected the pyschological effects that I had experienced due to having made a major incorrect decision in life. This ultimately led to my studies getting cut short. Afterwards I then went though consultations and processes to understand myself better and find what I wanted to do in life.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		By the beginning of 2020 I was now ready to pursue what I wanted to do in life (be an excellent Software Engineer) and I had planned to start Bootcamp at HyperionDev in June after gathering some funds. Unfortunately, That is when the covid-19 pandemic started though. At that point, I decided to get a job to help with the gathering of the finances required for the Bootcamp and I was eventually able to sign up in June 2021.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		It feels Like the start of a journey, and I look forward to give my all in this field.

		<h3> PERSONAL LIFE: </h3>
		
		<h4> GOALS/ INSPIRATION:</h4>
		<p>
		My inspiration is to be best that I can be and live up to my fullest potential, This is also fuelled by wanting to make my family proud as they have always supported me and never doubted my potential. A 10 year goal of mine is to achieve a masters in Computer Science. I want to do this part-time whilst working full-time though as to also find a way to fund my studies and increase in industrial knowledge, not just theoritical knowledge alone.
		</p>
		
		<h4> HOBBIES: </h4>
		<ul>
			<li> Programming: <br>
			<p> In my past time I like to challenge myself with programming solutions to queestions that I find mainly posted on YouTube. This allows me to increase my skills as well as see how better programmers approach the problems.
